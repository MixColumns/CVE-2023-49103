Small script to analyze shodan json downloads regarding [CVE-2023-49103](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49103). This is a very naive and fast written skript. If you already got a list of domains maybe try [https://github.com/creacitysec/CVE-2023-49103](https://github.com/creacitysec/CVE-2023-49103) instead. First param is the json file second param ist the output file. There are often some false positives but all accepted requests will be written as the domain + path to the outptut file (even though IP is the input).
